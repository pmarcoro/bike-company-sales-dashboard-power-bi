## Project Description

This project was developed as part of the course “Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence” from Maven Analytics.

AdventureWorks, a company specializing in bicycles and sports equipment, has experienced significant international growth in recent years. As business analysts, our aim is to develope an interactive Power BI dashboard using data from the AdventureWorks database to:

 - Analyze financial trends and evaluate the company’s overall performance.

 - Identify the most successful products and determine which ones generate the highest profitability.

 - Allow customer analysis and segmentation


## Dashboards

The business case analysis consists of four dashboards:

**1) Executive Dashboard:** Provides a quick overview of the company’s financial status. It highlights key performance metrics (revenue, profit, orders, and return rate) as well as the most popular and most profitable items.
